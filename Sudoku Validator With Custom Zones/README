Problem Statement
You are given a 9×9 Sudoku board. Your task is to validate whether the board satisfies the following rules:

Standard Sudoku Rules:
Each row must contain all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Each column must contain all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Each of the nine 3×3 sub-boxes must also contain all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Additional Rule - Custom Zones:
In addition to the above, you're also provided with a list of custom zones.

Each custom zone consists of exactly 9 unique cells defined by their row and column coordinates.

Each custom zone must also contain the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once (no duplicates or missing digits).

Your program must verify that all of the above rules are followed for the given board.

Constraints
The Sudoku board will be a 9×9 grid.

Each cell in the grid contains an integer from 1 to 9 (inclusive).

The number of custom zones z will satisfy: 1 <= z <= 10.

Each custom zone will contain exactly 9 unique (row, col) coordinate pairs.

Row and column indices range from 0 to 8.
