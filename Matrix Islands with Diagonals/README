You are given a 2D grid of size n × m, filled with 0s and 1s.

Your task is to count the number of distinct islands in the matrix. An island is a group of 1s connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Constraints
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000

Each cell is either 0 or 1

Time limit should be suitable for grid traversal (BFS/DFS)
Input Format
First line contains two integers: number of rows n and columns m
Next n lines each contain m space-separated values (0 or 1)
Output Format
A single integer representing the number of distinct islands
Sample Input 1:
4 5
1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
Sample Output 1:
