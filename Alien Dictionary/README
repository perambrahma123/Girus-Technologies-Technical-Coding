Description
Given a sorted list of words from an alien language, determine the order of characters in that language. Although the words use 
English lowercase letters (aâ€“z), the actual character order is unknown and must be inferred based on how the words are sorted.

This problem is a classic example of inferring topological order from a partial ordering of data.

Input Format
An integer n representing the number of words.

n lines, each containing a word. The words are sorted according to the alien dictionary.

Output Format
A single line containing a string representing the characters in the correct order for the alien language.

If the order cannot be determined (e.g., due to a cycle or invalid input), output:

Constraints
All words contain only lowercase English letters.

The list is non-empty and contains at least one word.

All words are sorted according to the alien language rules.

Approach
Graph Construction

Compare each pair of adjacent words to determine character precedence.

For the first differing character between two words, add a directed edge from the character in the first word to the one in the second word.

If a word is a prefix of another and comes later, it is an invalid order.

Topological Sorting

Use Kahn's Algorithm (BFS) to perform a topological sort of the characters.

Track in-degrees for each character.

If a cycle is detected (not all characters can be resolved), the order is invalid.

Sample Input:
5
wrt
wrf
er
ett
rftt
Sample Output:
Character order: wertf
