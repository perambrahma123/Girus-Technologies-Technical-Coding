Given an integer n, find the next greater integer that has the same number of binary 1s as n in its binary representation.

Example:
If n = 5, which is 101 in binary (has two 1s), the next greater integer with two 1s is 6 (110 in binary).

Constraints
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^9

The returned number must be greater than n

The binary representation must contain the same count of 1s as n
sample input 1: 5
sample output 1:6
sample input 2: 11
sample output 2:13
